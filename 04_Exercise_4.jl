# Exercise 4 (JULIA)
# 1. Create two matrices of the same layout and test if addition and subtraction of the matrix works as expected: C = A + B 
# 2. Now compare matrix multiplication either this way A * B and this way A .* B. Whats the difference?!
# 3. What about matrix division with "/" or "\"?!
# 4. Create a 3x3 integer matrix A with useful numbers. Now try A+1, A-1, A*2, A/2.
# 5. Now multiply a 3x4 matrix with a suitable (4)vector. 


# Part 1
matrix_a = rand(Int, 4,4)
matrix_b = rand(Int, 4,4)

println(matrix_a)
println(matrix_b)
